# Perf tests

Repeatable test runs for profiling and benchmarking.

To run benchmarks: `runBenchmarks.sh`

These take a while, so to run shorter tests, run `runSamples.sh`. These
won't produce results as repeatably as the benchmarks, but they're faster
to iterate on.

Comment out bits in Program.cs -> RunSamples as needed.
